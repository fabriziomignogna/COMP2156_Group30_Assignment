I canâ€™t say much about this course, since we only studied for a month, but I can say for sure that our teacher, Mr. Pritesh Patel, is a high-level specialist in devops, I myself have little experience in this industry, and in one month I already learned a lot of new things on this course and I think I will learn more.
